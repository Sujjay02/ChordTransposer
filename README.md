Daily Notes:
11/5/23: Created Repository, created basic input function and catch function for calling different songs in.
12/12/23: Restarted program using methods rather than the hashmap, hashmap will be saved for future iterations; created a method for transposing individual notes; Still have to account for sharp notes;
12/13/23: Finished V1, can now transpose a line of notes into different keys; no chord storing function yet; only reads in one line of code at a time
