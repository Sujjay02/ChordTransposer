         D/F#             G
In the darkness we were waiting
         A             D
Without hope, without light
            D/F#           G
Till from heaven You came running
           A             D
There was mercy in Your eyes
        D/F#            G
To fulfil the law and prophets
      A               D
To a virgin came the Word
          D/F#             G
From a throne of endless glory
       A
To a cradle in the dirt

D                  G
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Bm                Asus4     A
Praise the Spirit three in one
D             G
God of glory, Majesty
Bm        G           A
Praise forever to the King of Kings
